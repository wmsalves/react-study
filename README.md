# React Studies

This repository contains my studies and experiments related to the **React** library and its ecosystem. The focus is on learning core concepts, exploring React-related tools and frameworks (like Next.js and Vite), and applying them to practical scenarios. Future additions will include advanced topics and modern development patterns.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of React and its associated technologies. From core React concepts (like Hooks and components) to advanced state management and routing, I aim to build a solid foundation and explore real-world applications.

## Current Focus: Core React and Ecosystem

At this stage, the repository focuses on:

- **Core React:** Components (functional and class-based), JSX, Props, State, and Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).
- **React Ecosystem:** Client-side routing with React Router, global state management (e.g., Context API, Redux, or Zustand), and data fetching (Axios/Fetch).
- **Unit Testing:** Writing tests with **Jest** and **React Testing Library (RTL)** to ensure component reliability.

## Structure

The repository includes:
- **React Basics:** Examples of fundamental React concepts and syntax.
- **React Projects:** Sample applications (SPAs) showcasing routing, state management, and API integration.
- **Challenges and Solutions:** Problems solved using React to reinforce learning (e.g., custom hooks, UI challenges).
- **Future Additions:** Plans to include advanced topics like Next.js (SSR/SSG), performance optimization, and modern React patterns (e.g., Server Components).

## How to Run
